# race-simulator-c
A digital race simulation using C structures and random number generation.

Built a console-based race simulator in C to practice basic system concepts.

Core: Designed custom structs (Race/RaceCar) and used pointers for efficient state management without data copying (calling by ref).

System: Integrated windows.h header file to handle thread timing and console clearing for simulating real-time animation.

Logic: Implemented randomized algorithms to simulate driver speed and nerves.

A fun project that helped me really understand memory management and API integration
